These are a mix of various functions I wrote as an analyst at Eventbrite to
automate company reports.

Some are OS dependent (windows_excel_api).

- There are several python libraries that support writing to excel independent
of OS, however these are horrible for maintaining complex excel reports (ie.
with charts, formulas, dynamic tables, formatting etc.) and by horrible I mean
they break all of their functionality. WindowsCom is the best way to easily
write large datasets while maintaining any complex functionality.

The way I set these up to run at Eventbrite was through a windows machine I had
running at the office. Using dropbox, a mix of both pycron* and windows native
task scheduler, this computer would run 24/7 kicking off reports to various
groups & VPs throughout the night. In my opinion, sending out Excel reports is
far superior to static analysis that you could achieve in a variety of other
methods. Being able to provide a lot of complex data to individuals in a format
they are comfortable digging into themselves is extremely beneficial.

Analysts from different departments (marketing & product) leveraged these
functions and processes to automate their reports as well.
